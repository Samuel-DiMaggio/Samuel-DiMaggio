## About

When I was a kid, I was interested in becoming an astrophysicist. I remember reading so many astronomy related books with illustrations of black holes and massive red stars. In high school, I gravitated towards reading as many books from Physicists and Mathematicians such as Michio Kaku, Stephen Hawking, Paul Dirac, Richard Feynman, Lawrence Krauss, Roger Penrose, and others.

After graduating high school, I enlisted in the USAF and served for six years. For the first four years, I was an avionics technician specializing in Electronic Warfare and Computer Systems. For the remaining two years, I was assigned special duty as a Maintenance Operations Center Controller, controlling operations pertaining to maintenance of multiple aircrafts.

Once my enlistment ended, I moved to Salt Lake City, Utah to pursue a B.S. in Physics. My passion for physics carried me through my education at Westminster College. Here I found a new interest in coding after being exposed to programming languages such as Python, R, SAS, MATLAB, and Mathematica. After graduating, I decided to pursue a graduate degree in data science from Maryville University in St. Louis, MO. Before and during my degree, I would research and study topics of machine learning and deep learning.

Recently, I graduated from Maryville University, and I am continuing to research and expand my knowledge in data science related topics. Currently, I am pursuing cloud computing certificates and open to available job opportunities.
